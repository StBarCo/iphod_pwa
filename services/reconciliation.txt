    things done and left undone; especially __________. For these
    and all other sins that I cannot now remember, I am truly sorry.

    Let us pray.

| Plain
    O most loving Father, by your mercy you put away the sins
    of those who truly repent, and remember their sins no more.
    Restore and renew in your servant whatever has been corrupted
    by the fraud and malice of the devil, or by his own selfish will
    and weakness. Preserve and protect him within the fellowship of
    the Church; hear his prayers and relieve his pain; through Jesus
    Christ our Lord. *Amen*.

    The Priest concludes

    Go (or abide) in peace, and pray for me, a sinner.
