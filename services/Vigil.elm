    Dear Friends: It was our Lord Jesus /him/self who said, “Come to
    me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”
    Let us pray, then, for our brother N., that he may rest from his
    labors, and enter into God’s eternal Sabbath rest.

    But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters,
    about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others
    do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and
    rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with /him/
    those who have fallen asleep. For this we declare to you by a
    word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until
    the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen
    asleep.

    1 thessalonians 4:13-15

    In my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would
    I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?And if I go
    and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you
    to myself, that where I am you may be also.

    glory; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one
