    text: 
    Our Father, who art in heaven
        hallowed be thy Name,
        thy kingdom come,
        thy will be done,
        on earth as it is in heaven.
    Give us this day our daily bread.
    And forgive us our trespasses,
        as we forgive those
        who trespass against us.
    And lead us not into temptation,
        but deliver us from evil.
    For thine is the kingdom,
        and the power, and the glory,
        for ever and ever. Amen.

    Our Father in heaven,
        hallowed be your Name,
        your kingdom come,
        your will be done,

    Give us today our daily bread.
    And forgive us our sins
        as we forgive those
        who sin against us.
    Save us from the time of trial,
        and deliver us from evil.
    For the kingdom, the power,
        and the glory are yours,
        now and for ever. Amen.
