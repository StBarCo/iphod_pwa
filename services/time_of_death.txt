    For Christians, death is a defeated enemy. In Christ, death has
    become the gateway to everlasting life. As St. Paul reminded the
    Church at Corinth:
    The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But
    thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord
    Jesus Christ. 1 corinthians 15:54-57
    When a person is near death, the minister should be notified.
    This rite is a customary part of the Church’s pastoral care.
    This liturgy is intended to be prayed with one who has received
    Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. The Officiant may appropriately
    inquire of the dying person as to his or her acceptance of the
    Christian faith. If the person has not been baptized, Emergency
    Baptism (page 173) should be administered before the use of
    this rite.
    ‘Death is swallowed up in victory.
    O death, where is your victory?
    O death, where is your sting?’

| Section
    additional directions

| Plain
    This rite is designed to be flexible in length. It may be adjusted according
    to the circumstances and condition of the dying person. Different
    portions of the rite may be used at different times, provided the order
    of the various elements is retained. In cases of great urgency, the
    Commendation at the Time of Death may be used alone. In the absence
    of a member of the clergy, this service may be led by any Christian.
| Plain
    The minister may inquire of the dying person as to his or her desire
    to be reconciled to both God and neighbor. If the dying person feels
    troubled in conscience with any matter, the minister should offer the rite
    of Reconciliation of a Penitent. On evidence of repentance, the minister
    shall give assurance of God’s mercy and forgiveness.

| Plain
    If desired, Holy Communion may be administered using the rite for
    Communion of the Sick. It is appropriate for others present to receive
    the Sacrament as well. If the dying person cannot receive both the
    consecrated bread and wine, it is suitable to administer the Sacrament in
    one kind only. If he or she desires to receive, but by reason of extreme
    sickness is unable to consume either element, the minister is to assure
    the person that all the benefits of Holy Communion are conveyed, even
    though the elements are not received with the mouth.
