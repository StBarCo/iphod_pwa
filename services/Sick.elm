    ministry to the sick

| Rubric
    The Officiant begins

| Plain
    Savior of the world, by your Cross and precious blood you have
    redeemed us;

| Plain
    Save us, and help us, we humbly beseech you, O Lord.

| Rubric
    The Priest (or other authorized person) anoints the sick person’s forehead with the
    Oil of the Sick by making the sign of the Cross. If appropriate, other parts of the
    body which suffer from sickness or injury may also be anointed. Others may join
    in the laying on of hands. The Officiant says

| Plain
    N., I anoint you with oil and I (or we) lay my (or our) hands
    upon you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
    Holy Spirit. *Amen*.

| Plain
    Lord Jesus Christ, heal this your servant, sustain him with your
    presence, drive away all sickness of body, mind, and spirit, and
    give to him that victory of life and peace which will enable him
    to serve you both now and evermore. *Amen*.

| Rubric
    A Priest may add the following prayer. If this rite is used with multiple persons, it
    is appropriate for this prayer to be used after all have received individual prayer.

| Plain
    As you are outwardly anointed with this holy oil, so may our
    heavenly Father grant you the inward anointing of the Holy Spirit.  
    Of his great mercy, may he forgive you your sins, release you from
    suffering, and restore you to wholeness and strength. May he
    deliver you from all evil, preserve you in all goodness, and bring you
    to everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen*.

    Our Father, who art in heaven
        hallowed be thy Name,
        thy kingdom come,
        thy will be done,
        on earth as it is in heaven.
    Give us this day our daily bread.
    And forgive us our trespasses,
        as we forgive those
        who trespass against us.
    And lead us not into temptation,
        but deliver us from evil.
    For thine is the kingdom,
        and the power, and the glory,
        for ever and ever. Amen.

    The Officiant then prays

| Plain
    The Almighty Lord, who is a strong tower to all who put their trust
    in him, to whom all things in heaven, on earth, and under the earth
    bow and obey: Be now and evermore your defense, and make you
    know and feel that the only Name under heaven given for health
    and salvation is the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. *Amen*.
