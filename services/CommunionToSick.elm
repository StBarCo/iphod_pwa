    One of the following Gospel lessons is read, or the readings appropriate to the day.

| Quote
    God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that
    whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

| Ref
    john 3:16t

| Quote
    Jesus said, “I am the living bread that came down from
    heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.
    And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my
    flesh. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
    Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me,
    and I in him.”

| Ref
    john 6:51, 55-56

    Reflection on the Lessons may follow. Additional prayers may be offered.
    The Minister may say the Confession, and the sick person joins in as able.

| Prayer
    Most merciful God,
        we confess that we have sinned against you
        in thought, word and deed,
        by what we have done, and by what we have left undone.
    We have not loved you with our whole heart;
        we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
    We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
    For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,
        have mercy on us and forgive us;
        that we may delight in your will, and walk in your ways,
        to the glory of your Name. Amen.

    bring you to everlasting life; through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen*.
