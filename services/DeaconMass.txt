| Rubric
    Deacon and People

| Prayer
    We believe in one God,
        the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth,
        of all that is, visible and invisible.
    We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
        the only-begotten Son of God,
        eternally begotten of the Father,
        God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God,
        begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father;
        through him all things were made.
        For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven,
        was incarnate from the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary,
        and was made man.
        For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
        he suffered death and was buried.
        On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures;
        he ascended into heaven
        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
        He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
        and his kingdom will have no end.
    We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
        who proceeds from the Father [and the Son],
        who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified,
        who has spoken through the prophets.
        We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.
        We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.
        We look for the resurrection of the dead,
        and the life of the world to come. Amen.

    giving thanks he said, ‘Take this and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that from now on
    I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.’ Then he took a loaf of
    bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, ‘This is my body,
    which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.’

| Plain
    Today, we receive bread and wine consecrated at a previous service of this congregation [or of N.

    Walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

| Plain
    Lord Jesus Christ, by the Father's plan and by the working of the Holy Ghost, of your own free
    will you died, and mercifully redeemed the world from sin and everlasting death. We adore and
    venerate you as much as ever we can, though our love is so cold, our devotion so poor. Thank
    you for the good gift of this your holy Body and Blood, which we desire to receive as cleansing
    from sin, and for a defense against it. 

| Ref
    St. Anselm

| Plain
    Lord we acknowledge that we are far from worthy to approach and touch this sacrament; but we
    trust in that mercy which caused you to lay down your life for sinners, that they might be
    justified and because you gave yourself willingly as a holy sacrifice to the Father. 
    
| Ref
    St. Anselm

| Plain
    Make us O Lord, to be worthy to be incorporated into your body, which is the Church. And at
    the resurrection refashion the body of our humiliation according to the body of your glory, and
    we shall rejoice in you forever, to your glory, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and
    reigns forever. Amen.
